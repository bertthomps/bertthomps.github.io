      <p class="body">
        I create end-to-end product design, encompassing strategy, research, information architecture, user interface design, visual design, prototyping, and front-end coding.
        
        <br>

        My specialty is user interface and visual design, and I am fluent in Omnigraffle, Sketch, InVision, and Flinto.
        
        <br>

        Previously, Iâ€™ve worked in various analytical and creative capacities, from photography and film to lobbying and political journalism to project management and entrepreneurship.
        
        <br>

        I recently completed the User Experience Design Immersive bootcamp at General Assembly and hold a B.A. in Financial Economics with a Minor in Math from the University of Redlands.
